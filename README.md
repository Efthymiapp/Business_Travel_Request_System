# ✈️ Business Travel Request System – Procedural Information System
This project is part of my academic coursework and involves the design and implementation of a procedural information system that simulates the business travel approval and booking process within a company.

## 📌 Project Description
The goal of this system is to support a company’s employees in managing business travel requests, approvals, bookings, and reimbursements.

## 🧾 Process Overview
Company employees submit a travel request to management when they need to travel for business purposes.

A responsible manager reviews the request and either approves or rejects it:

- If rejected, a notification is sent to the employee and the process ends.

- If approved, the employee proceeds to organize the trip through a partner travel agency.

## 🧳 Booking through Travel Agency
The employee sends a booking request to the travel agency.

An agent logs the request and starts searching for travel options.

The agent then makes an initial offer to the employee.

The employee may request changes, and the agent sends updated offers as needed.

If the employee does not respond within 5 days, the agent sends a gentle reminder.

Once the employee accepts an offer, the agent:

Finalizes the booking

Arranges travel insurance

Sends the invoice to the employee

## 💳 Payment and Completion
If the employee pays the invoice, the agent sends the travel documents.

If not, the booking is cancelled.

## 🧾 Post-Travel Expense Submission
One day after the trip ends, the employee submits a list of travel expenses to the company’s management.

Upon review, the company sends a payment order to the accounting department to reimburse the employee for the eligible expenses.✈️ Business Travel Request System – Procedural Information System
